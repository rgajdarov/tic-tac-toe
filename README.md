# tic-tac-toe

This is my implementation of the game Tic-Tac-Toe written in C++. 
The game is terminal based and uses the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/">ncurses</a> library for its interface and terminal manipulation.
Enemy player AI is implemented using the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning(it plays perfect games).
